## Framework Agenda
* Create Maven project with Cucumber and Rest Assured dependencies
* Define project structure with Cucumber framework setup
* Create Feature file with the test cases to be automated
* Implement step definition files with supported code
* Build Utils file to define all reusable request and response specifications
* Build POJO classes for serializing and deserializing Json payload
* Implement logging into framework to log request and response details
* Develop End-to-End functionality test with all the validations and assertions
* Define global properties and drive all the global variables from properties file
* Define Enum class with constants to centralize all resource details
* Implement data driven mechanism to drive data dynamically from feature files
* Implement parameterization to run tests with multiple data sets using Cucumber Example keyword
* Add more tests and implement tagging mechanism to run selected tests from Test Runner file
* Implement Pre- and Post-conditions for tests with Cucumber Hooks
* Execute complete framework from maven commands
* Implement Maven driven global values into Test for dynamic execution
* Generate Reports for Test Execution Results
* Integrate Framework into Jenkins CI/CD tool
* Implement parameterized Jenkins job to choose the global values at run time
