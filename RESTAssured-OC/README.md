## Postman Essentials

* Create a new collection and a new test environment.
* Setup `baseUrl` https://api.postman.com as a variable in the test environment and link this environment to the newly created collection.
* Now the endpoint can be written as: {{baseUrl}}/workspaces
* Generate API Key:
  * Click on the profile icon in Postman APP and then Settings.
  * It will open up the browser. Click on the API keys section and then `+ Generate API Key`
  * Note the API key somewhere safe as Postman will mask it later.
  * Save this key as an environment variable
  * [Using your Postman API key](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key)
